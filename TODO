-SailCoeff will be entered by file. 
	The user can either leave the default or select the sail coeff file,
	which is a raw file with as many lines as the user wants. 0 and 180 are
	requested data
	
	this is a layout with QFileDialogs	

- …openCascade…


- Compute the derivative of a cubic spline, thus removing the FDs
- See RhinoAPI for getting LPP data
—————

- Ask Stephane about the multiple environment warning 
  	
- New definitions of the resistance with new version of the DYSHS

- Excel integration to save directly the files in .xlsx format

- Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 	mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!
