-> Something is wrong in the vppsettings while trying to prompt comma-separated values. 
	I conjecture this might be caused by Qt, that I have compiled for macos Sierra. Is this still fully compatible with Mojave? Finish recompiling Qt5.12 and hopefully the problem will magically disappear. 

-> Fix the import of the (old, deprecated) variableFile.txt. This way I can interactively 
	load the variableFile_ipOptFullTest and see what happens when the jacobian computation goes wrong. 

-> Improve the heavyside function

-> increase the min size of the 'value' column in the VppSettings tab so that it does not partially hide the header
 
-> there is a ton of duplicated code in VppHydroItem, see all the plots!	
	fixed for the viscousResistanceItem components, but for the other components


DeltaResistanceBase
	Delta_ResiduaryResistance_HeelItem
	Delta_ResiduaryResistanceKeel_HeelItem
	Delta_ViscousResistance_HeelItem

-> fix the runTest target and make this dependent on the VPP program (assure up-to-dateness)

-> RE-Allow the GUI to load variableFiles.txt (such as the one we use for testing)

-> Export results to excel format. Simply use .csv formatting

- Is it possible to write in multiple xcel tabs? 
  Ideally I would have vpp settings in the first tab, and the results in the second tab

-> Items should define a state vector, not a collection of variables!! See for example VppItem::updateSolution(int,int,Eigen::Vector&x)
	-> done 

-> Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 	mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!

-> Ask Stephane about the multiple environment warning 
  	
-> New definitions of the resistance with new version of the DYSHS

Questions: 
	See :
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsItemBounds::getItemMin() {
		return dynamic_cast<SettingsItemBase*>(child(0));
		}
	child is a method of Item, returning an Item. But the child is derived from
	SettingsItemBase, thus it has other methods I want to use, See for instance
	VariableParserGetVisitor::visit(SettingsItemBounds* pItem)
	wher I need to call getVariableName. This is a method for SettingsItemBase,
	not for Item. 
	Is there a better structure than dynamic_cast? 

	Also: 
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsModel::getRoot() const {
		return dynamic_cast<SettingsItemBase*>(VppItemModel::getRoot());
		}

	Also: 
		SettingsItemBase::settingsItemFactory
		Refactor the factory!
		I need to learn how to do a reasonable factory, this code is crap!
		
	Also: 
		I have chosen to templatize the items on their unit. This creates a lot 
		of problems when trying to convert the unit of an item. To do so I need 
		to instantiate a new item, which is akward. See for instance 
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsItem<Degrees>::convertToSI()
		Can I make a lighter design, with a non template item holding any unit?
