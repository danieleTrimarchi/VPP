- Delta_FrictionalResistance_HeelItem::plot() does not set the heel angle, but uses the current one. Not good. 

- Restore two optimisation variables reef and flat -> requires Lagrange multipliers 	to limit the solution? 

- Restore nlopt -> use the global optimiser and/or the augLag 
	  

- Items are contained into vectors, the sync is only assured by the position of the
	items in the vector. Better would be a mechanism of dependencies, where each
	item updates its dependency. Not sure how to deal with multiple items 		depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance and HeelingMoment both depend
	on AeroForce — we might end up updating some items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!

- use cppunit to make a test suite in main/test -> see howto in MEMSp

- eigen support for xcode?

- download and install Doxygen
