-> TO BE TESTED: Only save the SettingsModel to the ReferenceModel (and update the variableTree) if some  changes in the settings are detected	

-> Unify the base class for the VariableTree and the SettingsTree

-> Set Settings values when loosing focus from the SettingsItemWindow cell

-> parser print should work!
 
- Progression bar during runs…

- Add a control to choose the solver NLOpt IPOpt NRSolver (2 dofs). 
	This should go in Settings/General
- Exception in pathUtils if this is not MACOSX 
- Hide Variable tree by default
- Print df/dm in RELATIVE terms - the curves of df/dm are of the same color!

- …openCascade… Or other solid modelling tools?
	- Get pre-requisites : file:///Users/dtrimarchi/third_party/opencascade-7.1.0/doc/overview/html/occt_dev_guides__building_3rdparty_osx.html

- Compute the derivative of a cubic spline, thus removing the FDs
- See RhinoAPI for getting LPP data

- Ask Stephane about the multiple environment warning 
  	
- New definitions of the resistance with new version of the DYSHS

- Excel integration to save directly the files in .xlsx format

- Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 	mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!
