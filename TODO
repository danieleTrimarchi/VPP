-> restore Qt 5.9.1 and rebuild @rev660. Verify I get the same failure of ipOptFullRunTest:
iWv=0 iWa=0 iCmp=2
- Expected: 0.6860146
- Actual  : 0.68601120148518
- Delta   : 1e-06
If Yes : the system update has changed something -> update baselines and shut up
If No  : Something wrong has been introduced by the Qt update. But what and HOW? 


-> Remove the homeBrew qt in /usr/local/Cellar and free space...

-> Fix the target 'get_third_party' in main/SConscript with the content from the compileTest

-> Allow the GUI to load variableFiles such as the one we use for testing 

-> fix the runTest target and make this dependent on the VPP program (assure up-to-dateness)

-> try run without settings. We get a number of errors (I think the solver keeps going) This is stupid: on Input error we should be stopping after the first one

-> the analysis count (solving step n of m) is broken : m is not the right number

-> Fix the permissions of /Users/dtrimarchi/VPP/xCodeBuild/qrcVPP.cpp. This appears to break the xCode build - Why? 
It might be that I need to refresh the generated source list. Not sure where this lives but it was out sync, and removing the list seems to help


-> Export results to excel format. Simply use .csv formatting
- Is it possible to write in multiple tabs? 
 Ideally I would have vpp settings in the first tab, and the results in the second tab

-> Items should define a state vector, not a collection of variables!!

-> Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 	mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!

-> Ask Stephane about the multiple environment warning 
  	
-> New definitions of the resistance with new version of the DYSHS

Questions: 
	See :
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsItemBounds::getItemMin() {
		return dynamic_cast<SettingsItemBase*>(child(0));
		}
	child is a method of Item, returning an Item. But the child is derived from
	SettingsItemBase, thus it has other methods I want to use, See for instance
	VariableParserGetVisitor::visit(SettingsItemBounds* pItem)
	wher I need to call getVariableName. This is a method for SettingsItemBase,
	not for Item. 
	Is there a better structure than dynamic_cast? 

	Also: 
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsModel::getRoot() const {
		return dynamic_cast<SettingsItemBase*>(VppItemModel::getRoot());
		}

	Also: 
		SettingsItemBase::settingsItemFactory
		Refactor the factory!
		I need to learn how to do a reasonable factory, this code is crap!
		
	Also: 
		I have chosen to templatize the items on their unit. This creates a lot 
		of problems when trying to convert the unit of an item. To do so I need 
		to instantiate a new item, which is akward. See for instance 
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsItem<Degrees>::convertToSI()
		Can I make a lighter design, with a non template item holding any unit?
