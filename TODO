-> download should handle both tar.gz and zip
-> try the full procedure with the tar.gz






-> Export results to excel format. Simply use .csv formatting
- Is it possible to write in multiple tabs? 
 Ideally I would have vpp settings in the first tab, and the results in the second tab


-> Items should define a state vector, not a collection of variables!!

-> Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 	mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!

-> Ask Stephane about the multiple environment warning 
  	
-> New definitions of the resistance with new version of the DYSHS

Questions: 
	See :
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsItemBounds::getItemMin() {
		return dynamic_cast<SettingsItemBase*>(child(0));
		}
	child is a method of Item, returning an Item. But the child is derived from
	SettingsItemBase, thus it has other methods I want to use, See for instance
	VariableParserGetVisitor::visit(SettingsItemBounds* pItem)
	wher I need to call getVariableName. This is a method for SettingsItemBase,
	not for Item. 
	Is there a better structure than dynamic_cast? 

	Also: 
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsModel::getRoot() const {
		return dynamic_cast<SettingsItemBase*>(VppItemModel::getRoot());
		}

	Also: 
		SettingsItemBase::settingsItemFactory
		Refactor the factory!
		I need to learn how to do a reasonable factory, this code is crap!
		
	Also: 
		I have chosen to templatize the items on their unit. This creates a lot 
		of problems when trying to convert the unit of an item. To do so I need 
		to instantiate a new item, which is akward. See for instance 
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsItem<Degrees>::convertToSI()
		Can I make a lighter design, with a non template item holding any unit?
