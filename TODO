Can I compute the derivative of a cubic spline, thus removing the FDs?

Michele: 
	axes equal -> almost functional, perhaps ask Olivier
	Stability curve -> centre of buoyancy 
	Allow entering sail coefficients

See RhinoAPI for getting LPP data

- Ask Stephane about the multiple environment warning 

- Is it possible to compute analytical derivatives instead of numerical derivatives by finite differences? Presumably yes, I only need to write the code and check!

Well, this is painful because we do not have the expressions for the 

- add a scons target: scons makeTest : ask Stephane about execution path
	Hp : the code could simply search the files in a target path defined 
	in the sconscript. See what MEMSp does.
  	
- New definitions of the resistance with new version of the DYSHS

- Excel integration to save directly the files in .xlsx format

- Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 		mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!
