- Fix tests

- build ipOtp integration : 
	- refactor

- Is it possible to compute analytical derivatives instead of numerical derivatives by finite differences? Presumably yes, I only need to write the code and check! 

- logForCxx : drive the output with env vars

- add a scone target: scons makeTest : ask Stephane about execution path
	Hp : the code could simply search the files in a target path defined 
	in the sconscript. See what MEMSp does.
  
	
- build Qt integration. Allow for 2/3d dynamic plotting (scale, move, zoom). 
	in that phase think how to refactor the code in order to provide a flexible
	and well structured plotting utility. Perhaps using visitor?

- group resistanceItem plot(wind) -> at least part of this will be adressed with the previous item (Qt) 

- Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 		mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!

- eigen support for xcode?
