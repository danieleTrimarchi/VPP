- Verify the sign of the righting moment. Is it well positive, because we are kind of returning the abs? If it is not, we have a pb!

- With the induced resistance switch off, I am not sure that the solution exist (!!) 
	as the residuals do not go to zero though the NR dx -> 0. 
	This is true or it is cyclically true. 
	WHY? The solution MUST exist!! 
	-> reduce the number of iters for NR and follow what happens. Shit! 

 
	  

- Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 		mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!

- use cppunit to make a test suite in main/test -> see howto in MEMSp

- eigen support for xcode?

- download and install Doxygen
