the solver choice in the General Tab should also be saved with the settings!

Refactor the combo-boxes - see ctor of GeneralTab

I have nice combo-box in the 3d plot window. Can't I insert these in the item tree? 

Add a SailCoefficientFileReadTest. this is no different than the variableFileParserTest

Export results to excel format

Didn't I solve the combo-box appeareance. The settingswindow is not what I would like! See for instance the battens type in the Sail settings. Why?

Questions: 
	See :
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsItemBounds::getItemMin() {
		return dynamic_cast<SettingsItemBase*>(child(0));
		}
	child is a method of Item, returning an Item. But the child is derived from
	SettingsItemBase, thus it has other methods I want to use, See for instance
	VariableParserGetVisitor::visit(SettingsItemBounds* pItem)
	wher I need to call getVariableName. This is a method for SettingsItemBase,
	not for Item. 
	Is there a better structure than dynamic_cast? 

	Also: 
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsModel::getRoot() const {
		return dynamic_cast<SettingsItemBase*>(VppItemModel::getRoot());
		}

	Also: 
		SettingsItemBase::settingsItemFactory
		Refactor the factory!
		I need to learn how to do a reasonable factory, this code is crap!
		
	Also: 
		I have chosen to templatize the items on their unit. This creates a lot 
		of problems when trying to convert the unit of an item. To do so I need 
		to instantiate a new item, which is akward. See for instance 
		SettingsItemBase* SettingsItem<Degrees>::convertToSI()
		Can I make a lighter design, with a non template item holding any unit?

-> Set Settings values when loosing focus from the SettingsItemWindow cell
	This is supposedly already implemented --WHERE-- but it does not work!

-> parser print should work!
 
- Progression bar during runs…

- Add a control to choose the solver NLOpt IPOpt NRSolver (2 dofs). 
	This should go in Settings/General
- Exception in pathUtils if this is not MACOSX 
- Hide Variable tree by default
- Print df/dm in RELATIVE terms - the curves of df/dm are of the same color!

- New definitions of the resistance with new version of the DYSHS

- Excel integration to save directly the files in .xlsx format

- Items (resistance, wind, sails… ) are contained into vectors, the sync is only 		assured by the position of the items in the vector. Better would be a 	mechanism of dependencies, where each item updates its dependency. Not sure 	how to deal with multiple items depending on one item (i.e: InducedResistance 	and HeelingMoment both depend on AeroForce — we might end up updating some 		items twice. 
	To be investigated on UML!
